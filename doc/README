 README FOR THE QPASSWD PACKAGE
================================

The qpasswd tools are a collection of various tools (checkpasswd, checkqpasswd,
multicheckpw, and others). They are meant for use with checkpassword-compatible
authentication programs like qmail-popup and qmail-smtpd. Currently, the
following auth mechanism are supported: plain, login, apop, cram-md5, cram-sha1,
cram-ripemd, and digest-md5. No special libraries are required, and it compiles
against dietlibc.


We have currently 5 tools:

1. multicheckpw
   - with this program, you can use multiple program, which use the
     checkpassword interface

2. checkqpasswd
   - with this program, you can authenticate virtual users, which don't
     really exist on your system
   - authentication is done against the /etc/qpasswd database, which
     consists on 'user:homedir' pairs ... the clean text password is
     saved in the .qpasswd in the home directory of the user
   - see qpasswd.5 + checkqpasswd.8 for more information about this

3. checkpasswd
   - with this program, you can authenticate users against the /etc/passwd
     database

4. qpasswd
   - with this program, you can manage the accounts of the virtual users of
     the /etc/qpasswd database (xxx: not ready yet!)

5. test-cases
   - during compilation this program is executed for testing the correctness of
     the crypto functions: hmac_md5 + hmac_ripemd + hmac_sha1
