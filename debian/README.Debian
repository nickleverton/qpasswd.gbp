qpasswd for Debian
------------------

This package differs from standard qpasswd in that the
{/multicheckpw,checkpasswd,checkqpasswd,qpasswd} executable is mode 4511
rather than 4510.  This allows the program to be used without needing
to have all of smtpd, pop3d, imapd running under the same group.  It is
however much less secure, as anyone with access to the binary can run
any program under any userid in /etc/qpasswd.
